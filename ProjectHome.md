# About #
This app will time and analyse task switching. The purpose of this program is to utilize the Android API to show the abilities of the operating system and its programmatic interfaces. As mentioned before, this program is designed for academic purposes only.

# Current build #
Current build have a full functioning user interface, with services creation and deletion by user. Program will time the creation and switching to services under a single process or under separate processes (in milliseconds). The current version will be the final for this exercise, and will be sufficient to show the results successfully. I recommend to try this in several android machines, to compare the differences in comparison to hardware available.

**Recent changes (version 1.0)**
  * some bug fixes in timing
  * outside process changed to wallpaper
  * rebinding services for easier stopping
