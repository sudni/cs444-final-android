=User Interface=

This page will explain my experiences in building the user interface for this application. It will include a brief description of how the user interface works, different problems I encountered and how I solved them.

===Layout===

  * Android interface is based in xml files with different attributes that account for the various features in a given window (i.e activity). 

  * There are while holding the machine in landscape mode, some of the buttons were cutout. I realized that Android enables us to create a separate layout for landscape (under /red/layout-land/file.xml) without any extra pointers. The existence of the file under that directory is sufficient for it to be used. I ended up creating a table and placing the buttons in separate columns, to prevent the cutoff.
