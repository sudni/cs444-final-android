#summary Services - how they work and what we can do about it

= Services =

A Service is an application component that can perform long-running operations in the background and does not provide a user interface. Another application component can start a service and it will continue to run in the background even if the user switches to another application. Additionally, a component can bind to a service to interact with it and even perform interprocess communication (IPC). For example, a service might handle network transactions, play music, perform file I/O, or interact with a content provider, all from the background. (Android official Dev)

//TODO my timing strategy


=== Running services ===

Android offers a services manager that is being supported natively since version 2.0. This services manager will display all the running services and group them by process (usually a process is connected to one app, unless binded with another). Running services also shows available memory and running time.

I was trying to create a button that will send the user to the running services activity window. Though Google does not provide any documentation to this activity, I thought I will be able to find it by myself. I researched for over 30 hours, and sent emails to other developers who managed to link their software with this activity. I knew this tool will make the management of the timing feature easier to use. Eventually I realized this task will be either impossible for me to perform (due to signing issues) or will take too long to reconstruct the window from scratch. 
I manages to get the following list that provided me with a list of running services:
{{{
...
ActivityManager activityManager = (ActivityManager) getSystemService(ACTIVITY_SERVICE);
    	List<ActivityManager.RunningServiceInfo> runningServices = activityManager.getRunningServices(50);
    	for (int i = 0; i < runningServices.size(); i++) {
    		ActivityManager.RunningServiceInfo runningServiceInfo = runningServices.get(i);
	    	Log.i(APP_TAG, "Process " + runningServiceInfo.process + " with component " + 
	    			runningServiceInfo.service.getClassName());
    	}
...
}}}

In order to get the correct layout shown, I changed the manifest file to accomodate for my request with the following:

{{{
...
 <activity android:name="runningServices"
              android:label="@string/runningservices_settings_title"
              android:clearTaskOnLaunch="true">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.MONKEY" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.VOICE_LAUNCH" />
            <category android:name="com.android.settings.SHORTCUT" />
        </intent-filter>
    </activity>
...
}}}

To get the layout ifself to show my new made list, I created a Linear layout and nested a list view inside:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout 
	xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:layout_width="fill_parent"
    android:layout_height="fill_parent"
    >
    
    <ListView 
    	android:id="@+id/listView1" 
    	android:layout_width="match_parent" 
    	android:layout_height="fill_parent">
    </ListView>
        
</LinearLayout>
}}}

Despite my efforts, I ended up with a non working solution. It's hard to pinpoint the heart of the problem. All the feedback I've received was a force close (crash) when I load up the services activity. It could be that I did not ask for enough [permissions], or mis-configured the manifest activity. Either way, I've spent too many hours and deviated too far from the main goal (for what I thought will take and hour or two, and ended up being a 30 hour obsession). I will not implement the running services activity (it's not even in the defined deliverable), though the work that was invested in it deserve to be mentioned. 

Throughout the process I learned the manipulation of services, which I am sure will help me in getting the timing done correctly and efficiently.
